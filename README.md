**SaveOverIt** is a utility for saving your progress in the game Getting Over it. 

Save hours of frustration by giving yourself a chance to practice techiniques and strategies for those hard spots in the game! 

### But this is cheating!

Quite so! 

### I want it! 

Download the application [here](#http://google.com) 

## How do I use it? 

After [downloading](#google.com), right click on the executable and select **Run as Administrator.** Note, that this step is _super_ important! Getting Over It stores all of its save data in the Windows Registry which programs need heightened permissions to access. 

Don't want to run a random program as an administrator? _Smart_. The more paranoid users can [checkout the code](#) and run it directly (after a thorough inspection).  


### This goes against the spirit of the game! Why would you do this?! 

I really, _really_ enjoy the mechincs. I don't enjoy the punishing grind of some of its parts. I play games to have fun.

Also, it only took a few minutes to do. 

### Nice UI. How'd you make it?

I used [Gooey](#https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)! Convert your command line programs into full user friendly interfaces with just one line of Python! 

## What should I know before I run this?

1. **SaveOverIt** makes absolutely no guarantees of working now nor in the future. It was developed against the 1.5 verion of Getting Over it in order to scratch a person itch. 

2. Upon restoring a save file, your mouse sensitivity settings will be lost. I don't actually know why ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
 you'll have to manually reset them in the settings menu.
