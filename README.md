**SaveOverIt** is a utility for saving your progress in the game Getting Over it. 

Save hours of frustration by giving yourself a chance to practice techiniques and strategies for those hard spots in the game! 

### But this is cheating!

Quite so! 

### I want it! 

Download the application [here](#http://google.com) 

### This goes against the spirit of the game! Why would you do this?! 

I enjoy the mechincs. I don't enjoy the punishing grind of some of the parts. I play games to have fun.


### Sweet UI! How'd you make it so quickly!? 

A little thing called [Gooey](#https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)! Get the User Interface side of your code with just one line of Python!
