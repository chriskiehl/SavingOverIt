**SaveOverIt** is a utility for saving your progress in the game Getting Over it. 

Save hours of frustration by giving yourself a chance to practice techiniques and strategies for those hard spots in the game! 

### But this is cheating!

Quite so! 

### I want it! 

Download the application [here](#http://google.com)

## How do I use it? 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408720/34638090-80587336-f279-11e7-91f6-d0db2803cbac.png" align="right" width="400" height="auto">

After [downloading](#google.com), right click on the executable and select **Run as Administrator.** Note, that this step is _super_ important! Getting Over It stores all of its save data in the Windows Registry which requires heightened permissions to access. 

Once running, you've got two options: 

* Save a new snapshot 
* Restore a previous snapshot 

You can save at any time. However, to restore a snapshot, you need to either (a) be on the initial screen of the game, or (b) not have the game running at all. If you try to restore a snapshot while _playing_ that game nothing will happen, as the registry is only read when you transition from the title screen to the main game.  

>If you don't want to run a random program off the internet with admin privileges, you can download the code directly from the project page [here](https://github.com/chriskiehl/SavingOverIt) and run it manually via Python (after a thorough inspection, of course!).  


### This goes against the spirit of the game! Why would you do this?! 

I really, _really_ enjoy the mechincs. I don't enjoy the punishing grind of some of its parts. I play games to have fun.

Also, it only took a few minutes to do. 

### Nice UI. How'd you make it?

I used [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)! Convert your command line programs into full user friendly interfaces with just one line of Python! 

## What should I know before I run this?

1. **SaveOverIt** makes absolutely no guarantees of working now nor in the future. It was developed against the 1.5 verion of **Getting Over it** in order to scratch a person itch. Use at your own risk!!

2. Upon restoring a save file, your mouse sensitivity settings will be lost. I don't actually know why ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
 you'll have to manually reset them in the settings menu. 


## Happy Climbing!
